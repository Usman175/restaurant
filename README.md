## Built With
 - [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
 - [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)


This is my second application built with react native. I built this application in hope of digging out social authentication like (Facebook, Gmail) and Google Maps. It gives direction how to go to a particular place.For authentication I used Facebook and Google sign In api maintained by Redux state. This nearly has the urges to use database. For that i used AsyncStorage. All the information displayed are from google map and places API. For that i used libraries like which uses google map and places in the background.
 

I would really appricate any suggestions, feedback, PRs and Issues.


## Walkthrough

![Preview](./src/assets/detail.gif)
![Preview](./src/assets/direction.gif)

In Singn in and Sign Up i used components own state combining Redux state.

Upon successful sign in or sign up, the user will be directed to the home page. These page are created using the [React native router flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux). 


The App contains is consists of three tabs -

 - Home
 - Create new blog
 - Notifications (which is under developed)

These are swipeable tabs that are created by using the library [React native router flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux). 
The top navigation bar comes also with it. There is also a drawer or side bar present there.  It consists of

- Home
- Search
- Map
- Bookmarks

The "Home" component is a basically [Flat list](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist.html).  All the data are coming from Google Map API's. In home page user will be displayed with nearby resturant's. Clicking on any restaurnt there will be a siingle page for that particular restaurant will be opened. Which contins Information about that restaurant such as contact, direction to go there, reviews, menu's and images.  Though google doesn't provides any info about menu and image i just added some static data. 


### Debugging & crash-reporting:

Debugging of was pretty straight forward using the built in debug option. Rather than this i used [React native debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger), which gives me more flexibilty of debugging and waching over redux state. 

Upon installing the app i had faced some issues that caused the app crash and my bust my head of. By searching and asking on different communities i found some pretty good crash report tools. Among them i found love in [bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/). They came up with some pretty good well formatted crash report.
